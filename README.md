### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am in week 3 of of Turing's Front-End software development program. I was given just a basic HTML skeleton for this project. I wrote the JavaScript, CSS, and the majority of the HTML and it took approximately 10 hours to complete. The project specs can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The main learning goals of this project were to gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript and to understand how to listen to and respond to user events.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Completeing this project completely solo was a big win for me. It solidified my understanding of these concepts and helped increase my confidence. 
The biggest challenge I faced was trying to understand how to work with radio buttons.
